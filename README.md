# Raspberry Pi 4 Desk Case

I wanted to have a Raspberry Pi 4 on my desk to run various tasks and also wanted to have active cooling for it. I came across the *GeeekPi Raspberry Pi 4 Fan* on Amazon and loved how overkill it seemed. I decided to order the cooler and design a 3D printed case to fit around it all.
